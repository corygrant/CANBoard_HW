# CANBoard_HW
CANBoard is a simple CAN enabled IO board, specifically designed to be used in devices like steering wheels/button boxes/panels/etc.

* 8 digital inputs
    * Ground switching
* 5 analog inputs
    * 5V max
* 4 digital outputs
    * Low side switch (open collector)
    * 0.5A max each
* STM32F303K8
* KiCad 7.0.0

# Goals
- Create a low cost device that my friends and I can use in our project cars
- Use components that are easily soldered by hand (hence 0805) and are preferably from my stock of frequently used parts (ex: LD1117S33CTR)
- Share my work with others for reference, inspiration or collaboration. 

If this project does help you in any way, I'd appreciate a message!

# Jumpers
**CAN Term** : Soldering this jumper enables the 120 ohm terminating resistor across CANL/CANH

**CAN ID Jumpers 1 and 2** : Soldering these jumpers allows different base CAN IDs to be selected when using multiple CANBoards in the same bus
| 1      | 2      | Base CAN ID (Hex)|
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Open   | Open   | 0x640 |
| Closed | Open   | 0x650 |
| Open   | Closed | 0x660 |
| Closed | Closed | 0x670 |
